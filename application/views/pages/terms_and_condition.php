                <h2 class="cn-tn">Welcome to nSmarTrac!</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by NSMART, LLC
                  (“nSmarTrac”), located in Florida, United States.
                  By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
                  Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age
                  requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those
                  additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Using our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
                    Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using
                    a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services
                    only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We
                    may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or
                    if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or
                    the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission
                    from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any
                    branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in
                    or along with our Services.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    Our Services display some content that is not nSmarTrac’s. This content is the sole responsibility of
                    the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates
                    our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our
                    policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t
                    assume that we do.
                    In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements,
                    administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those
                    communications.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that
                    distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Your nSmarTrac Account</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> Accounts. If you sign up to use the platform of services and applications, you will be required to
                    create an account and provide billing information to nSmarTrac. You acknowledge that you will be
                    required to accept the terms of the nSmarTracEnd User License Agreement (EULA) prior to your use
                    of the nSmarTrac Services and will be bound by its terms in your use of the nSmarTrac Services. In
                    the event of any inconsistency between the terms of use (TOU) and the EULA, the terms of the EULA
                    shall govern. You may also need a nSmarTrac Account in order to use some of our additional
                    premium Services. You may create your own nSmarTrac Account, or your nSmarTrac Account may
                    be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are
                    using a nSmarTrac Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may
                    apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    To protect your nSmarTrac Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the
                    activity that happens on or through your nSmarTrac Account. Try not to reuse your nSmarTrac
                    Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password
                    or nSmarTrac Account, contact us at support@nsmartrac.com.

                <h2 class="cn-tn">Privacy and Copyright Protection</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> nSmarTrac’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when
                    you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that nSmarTrac can use such data in
                    accordance with our privacy policies.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers
                    according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you
                    think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about
                    submitting notices and nSmarTrac’s policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.
                </p> 
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Your Content in our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain
                    ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to
                    you stays yours.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    You can find more information about how nSmarTrac uses and stores content in the privacy policy
                    or additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services,
                    we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
                </p> 
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">About Software in our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically
                    on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your
                    automatic update settings.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    nSmarTrac gives you a personal, worldwide, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the
                    software provided to you by nSmarTrac as part of the pay Services. This license is for the sole
                    purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by nSmarTrac, in
                    the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of
                    our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source
                    code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under
                    an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open
                    source license that expressly override some of these terms.
                </p> 
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Modifying and Terminating our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or
                    features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    You can stop using our Services by providing us a 90 days notice, although we’ll be sorry to see you
                    go. nSmarTrac may stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any
                    time.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we
                    discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a
                    chance to get information out of that Service.
                </p> 
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that
                    you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER
                    NSMARTRAC NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE
                    SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN
                    THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY,
                    AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
                    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE
                    EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Liability for our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, NSMARTRAC, AND NSMARTRAC’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS,
                    WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR
                    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF NSMARTRAC, AND ITS SUPPLIERS
                    AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED
                    WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE
                    CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).
                </p> 
                <p>    
                    IN ALL CASES, NSMARTRAC, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
                    ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">Business uses of our Services</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold
                    harmless and indemnify nSmarTrac and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any
                    claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms,
                    including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation
                    costs and attorneys’ fees.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2 class="cn-tn">About these Terms</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect
                    changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post
                    notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in
                    the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than
                    fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or
                    changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified
                    terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control
                    for that conflict.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    These terms control the relationship between nSmarTrac and you. They do not create any third party
                    beneficiary rights.
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that
                    we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
                </p> 
                <p>     
                    If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
                    The laws of Florida, U.S.A., excluding Florida’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes
                    arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these
                    terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Escambia County,
                    Florida, USA, and you and nSmarTrac consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
                </p>
